# Text Formatting
This is a piece work from COMP10002 Foundation of Algorithmn Project 1(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 09/2019 with C programming.

In this project I am going to journey back to the 1970s, and implement a simple text formatting tool based entirely on fixed-width terminal fonts and character-based output. The formatting “commands” will be indicated by input lines that start with a period, “.”, with the command indicated by the letter in the next character position. For example, the characters “.p” in the first two positions of a line are (in this simple language) the signal to start a new paragraph in the output.

1.c is the code file, others are test cases.
